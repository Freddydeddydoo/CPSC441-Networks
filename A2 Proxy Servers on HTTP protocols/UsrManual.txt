WEBPROXY.TXT is a web proxy created for the purpose of opening and browsing HTTP webpages... with a cactch! 

The creator of this proxy absolutley HATES frogs and desires a world without those detesable fiends. In addition to that, 

the creator's nickanme in highschool was "Freddy" or "Fred" for short. Saying that, for every instance of the word 'frog' 

in a HTTP webpage, the proxy will replace it with 'fred.'


Note: I tried to do the images too but I just could not. Will try to resolve issue before the in person meeting.

How to use:

    1. Make sure your brower accepts proxy connections.

        1. Open 'settings' in your browser of choice.

        2. go to proxy settings.

        3. allow proxies and then set host to whatever the proxy is running on.

        and port to 8184.

        4. (MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS EVERY INSTANCE) Reset cache on your device.

    2. Compile code using g++ WebProxy.cpp on a linux-based device.

    3. Run file with ./a.out .

    4. Quickly open up the desired HTTP webpage. 

     ~~ The webpage should load, and everything should be presented in the terminal. ~~

    5. The while loop doesn't allow for continued use so everytime you want to open a new page,
    
     go back and repeat step 1 part 4 (clear cache) and step 3.
