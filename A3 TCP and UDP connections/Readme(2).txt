How to use the Vowelizer program.

Before continuing, I want to stress that I am using c++ version 11.4.0.

some bugs. 

I lost track of where I closed the client socket on the server and I am pretty sure thats
why I cannot reuse the code in the while loop.

If you press enter or enter a newline when asked to input a number, the entire thing breaks and 
you will need to restart.


1. Compile nuSeverver.cpp and nuClient.cpp. Make sure
you compule the server before the client and make sure you name the compiled 
files differently.

2. Run server and client then choose one of the 5 options. (WARNING, merge does not work at all!)

3. For split, input a a sentence and press enter. you should get a repsonse immediatly. If none arrive, restart the 
program by tpying "Crtl+C" on your keyboard for both client and server.


3. for merge (incomplete) enter two strings, and wait for a resposne.

4. if you want to restart, the menu refreshed so you can reinput another value.
if you do not get a response immediatly. simply end both programs (with ctrl+c) 
and try again.
